      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>My curent position (I am an econimist by the way) doesn't satisfied me. 
        It seems that I stopped growing professionaly.<br>
        So I guess I want to make a career change and programming is a very good chance for me. 
        And learning at this courses will be the first step to the new career path.</p>
